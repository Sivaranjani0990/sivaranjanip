In this level, the password for the next level is obtained by interacting with a network service that requires the correct password to be sent to it.

Login to Bandit Level 20 using SSH:ssh bandit20@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
After login, the current working directory is the home directory of bandit20.
An executable file named suconnect is present.
Open one terminal and start listening on a port using nc:
->nc -l 12345
Open another terminal and execute the binary, passing the port number:
-> ./suconnect 12345
When prompted, send the current password through the listening port.
The service returns the password for the next level.
