Login to Bandit Level 25 using SSH:ssh bandit25@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
After login, the current working directory is the home directory of bandit25.
->List the files in the directory:ls
A private key file named bandit26.sshkey is present.
Use the private key to attempt login to Bandit Level 26:ssh -i bandit26.sshkey bandit26@localhost
The session exits immediately due to a restricted shell.
Change the terminal window size to a very small dimension and reconnect to force the shell into an interactive mode.
