In this level, the password for the next level is printed immediately upon login, but the session closes automatically.

Login to Bandit Level 18 using SSH:ssh bandit18@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
Since the password is displayed immediately, 
use SSH with a command to capture it without opening an interactive session:
->ssh bandit18@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220 cat readme
The command outputs the password for the next level.
