In this level, I logged into Bandit Level 1 using the password obtained from the previous level.
Command used to login:

-> ssh bandit1@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
After successful login, I was in the home directory of bandit1.
To see the files present in the directory, 
-> used:ls
 found a file named - (dash).
Since - is treated as a command, used ./- to access the file properly.
Command used:cat ./-
The file displayed the password for Bandit Level 2.
